Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants

copy, and modify the Software solely for Personal Use, Educational Use, or

## 4. Enterprise Configuration Key

Use of the encrypted enterprise configuration ("Embedded Config") requires a
valid, signed configuration key obtained directly from Handaptive LLC under an
active commercial license agreement. Each configuration key is issued to a
specific organization and may only be used by that organization.

You may only decrypt, load, or otherwise use the Embedded Config while you
maintain a valid contract with Licensor and are current on all associated
payments. If your contract expires, is terminated, or you are otherwise not in
good standing, the Embedded Config must not be used and any cached or decrypted
configuration data must be discarded immediately.

The configuration key and this License become invalid upon expiration of or
termination of your commercial agreement with Licensor. You may obtain a new
configuration key by renewing or entering into a new commercial agreement with
Licensor.

Unauthorized use of the Embedded Config constitutes a material breach of this
License.
