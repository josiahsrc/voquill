description: Define organization-wide writing styles that apply to every user.
---

Global styles let you define writing styles that are shared across every Voquill desktop app in your organization. Any style you add here automatically becomes available to every user — giving your entire team a consistent set of writing options without per-user configuration.

## How It Works

Global styles work the same way as the [personal styles](/guides/styles/) built into each desktop app, but at the organization level. Styles defined here are pushed to all connected desktop clients and are available for selection immediately.

Each style has a name and a prompt that controls how Voquill's AI rewrites the raw transcription.

## Why Use Global Styles

Managing styles at the organization level lets you curate a consistent voice across your team. Instead of each person writing their own prompts, you can define styles once and distribute them to everyone.

This is useful when you want to:

- Enforce a consistent writing voice for external communication
- Provide ready-made styles for common workflows (emails, meeting notes, documentation)
- Iterate on prompt quality in one place rather than asking every user to update individually

Once you've landed on styles that work well, everyone in the organization gets them automatically.

## Managing Styles

From the **Global Styles** tab in the admin portal you can add, edit, and delete styles. Each style requires a name and a prompt.

## Global vs Personal Styles

Global styles appear alongside the built-in styles on every user's desktop app. Individual users can still create personal styles for anything specific to their own workflow. Both global and personal styles are available for selection in the style picker.
