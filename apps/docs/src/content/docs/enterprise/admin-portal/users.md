The Users section of the admin portal gives you full visibility and control over who has access to Voquill in your organization.

## Seat Management

Your enterprise license includes a fixed number of seats. The users page shows how many seats are currently filled and how many are available. When all seats are in use, new users cannot be added until a seat is freed up.

To swap a seat, delete an existing user and invite a new one in their place.

## Viewing Users

The user list shows everyone who currently has access to Voquill in your organization. You can see:

- Who has been provisioned
- Who has signed in
- Their current status

This makes it easy to audit access and identify inactive accounts that may be taking up seats.

## Resetting Passwords

If a user is locked out or needs a password reset, you can trigger one directly from the admin portal. Select the user and reset their password — no need to go through email-based recovery flows.

## Deleting Users

You can remove users from the admin portal at any time. Deleting a user frees up their seat, which can then be assigned to someone else. This is useful when team members leave the organization or no longer need access.
