The Settings section of the admin portal gives you an overview of your enterprise license and lets you control organization-wide behavior.

## License Information

From settings you can view:

- **Seat count** — how many seats are included in your license and how many are currently in use.
- **License details** — your license tier and when it expires.

If your license is approaching expiration, refer to the renewal guide for your deployment type:

- [Managed Cloud Renewal](/enterprise/managed-cloud/renewal/)
- [Self-Hosted Cloud Renewal](/enterprise/self-hosted-cloud/renewal/)
- [On-Premise Renewal](/enterprise/on-premise/renewal/)

## Feature Flags

Feature flags let you enable or disable specific Voquill features across your entire organization. This gives you control over which capabilities are available to your users without needing to modify any configuration on individual machines.

## Signing Out

You can sign out of the admin portal from the settings page. This ends your admin session — it does not affect any desktop app users.
