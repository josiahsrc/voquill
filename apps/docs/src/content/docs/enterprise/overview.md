Voquill Enterprise brings private, AI-powered voice OS to your entire organization. Whether you need a fully managed cloud, your own cloud deployment, or a completely on-premise installation, Voquill gives you the flexibility to run voice infrastructure on your terms.

## Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Managed Cloud** | We deploy and manage a dedicated Voquill cloud instance for your organization. |
| **Self-Hosted Cloud** | Deploy Voquill on your own cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.). |
| **On-Premise** | Run Voquill entirely on your own hardware with no external dependencies. |

All three options give your organization complete control over your data. Nothing leaves your environment unless you want it to.

## Open Source, Licensed

Voquill's code is fully open source and available for inspection. Running an enterprise deployment requires a commercial license as defined in our license terms. This means total transparency -- your security team can audit every line of code that runs in your environment.

## Getting Started

To get your enterprise license and begin deployment, contact us at [enterprise@voquill.com](mailto:enterprise@voquill.com). We provide white-glove onboarding to get your organization up and running:

1. We'll work with you to determine the right deployment option for your needs.
2. We'll provision your license and walk you through setup.
3. Distribute the Voquill desktop app to your team across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Why Enterprise?

- **Private voice OS** -- your voice data stays within your infrastructure.
- **Total transparency** -- open-source code you can audit and verify.
- **Cross-platform** -- supports macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **On-device processing** -- local Whisper inference with no network calls required.
- **Centralized management** -- admin controls for your entire organization.
