The morning light slipped through the blinds in thin, bright stripes, turning dust into slow-moving constellations and making the room feel briefly weightless. Somewhere outside, a car rolled past on wet pavement, the sound fading like a thought you almost remembered, and the air held that quiet in-between quality—not quite silence, not quite motion. You could sense the day arranging itself in the background: messages waiting, small decisions piling up, the familiar pull of plans and obligations. But for a moment, everything stayed simple, as if time had paused to let you choose your next step on purpose.
