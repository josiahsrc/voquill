# Terms of Service

_Last updated: February 24, 2026_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a legal agreement between you and **Handaptive LLC** ("we," "us," or "our"), governing your use of the Voquill application, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). **By using Voquill, you agree to these Terms.** If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Description of the Service

Voquill is a voice typing application that lets you dictate text using your voice, with optional AI-powered post-processing. Voquill is available as a desktop application (macOS, Windows, Linux), a mobile application (iOS), and an enterprise deployment.

## 2. Service Modes

Voquill offers multiple operating modes, each with different data handling characteristics:

- **Local mode:** Voice processing happens entirely on your device using an embedded speech-to-text model. No audio or text data leaves your device.
- **Cloud mode:** Audio is sent to our cloud infrastructure for transcription and optional post-processing, then the resulting text is returned to your device. Audio is processed transiently and is not stored on our servers.
- **API key mode (BYOK):** You provide your own API keys for third-party AI providers. Audio and text are sent directly from your device to the provider you configure. We do not intermediate or store this data.
- **Enterprise mode:** Your organization hosts its own Voquill server. Data handling is governed by your organization's policies and your agreement with them.

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use Voquill. If you are under 18, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.

## 4. Account Registration

Some features of the Service require an account. When you create an account, you agree to provide accurate information and keep it up to date. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.

An account is not required to use Voquill in local or API key mode.

## 5. Subscriptions and Payments

Voquill offers free and paid subscription plans. Paid plans are billed through Stripe (desktop/web) or the Apple App Store via RevenueCat (mobile). By subscribing to a paid plan, you agree to the applicable pricing and billing terms presented at the time of purchase.

- Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the end of the current billing period.
- You may manage or cancel your subscription through your account settings or the applicable app store.
- Refunds are handled in accordance with the policies of the payment processor or app store through which you subscribed.

## 6. Usage Limits

Cloud-based features are subject to usage limits that vary by plan. Current limits are displayed in the application. We reserve the right to modify these limits with reasonable notice.

## 7. Your Content

You retain ownership of all text, audio, and other content you create using Voquill ("Your Content"). We do not claim any ownership rights over Your Content.

- **Transcriptions** are stored locally on your device. We do not store your transcription text or history on our servers.
- **Voice data** is never retained by us. In cloud mode, audio is processed transiently to produce a transcription and is not saved.

## 8. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any proprietary components of the Service (the open-source components are governed by their respective licenses).
- Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or related systems.
- Use the Service to transmit malware or other harmful code.
- Resell or redistribute access to the cloud Service without our permission.

## 9. Open Source

Voquill's source code is available under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3). Your use of the source code is governed by that license. These Terms govern your use of the hosted Service, pre-built applications, and any features or infrastructure we provide beyond the open-source code.

## 10. Third-Party Services

Voquill integrates with third-party services depending on your configuration, including but not limited to Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Deepseek, OpenRouter, Azure, and others. When you use these integrations (whether through our cloud or your own API keys), your use is subject to the respective provider's terms and policies. We are not responsible for the practices of third-party providers.

## 11. Privacy

Your privacy matters to us. Please review our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for details on how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## 12. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not guarantee that:

- The Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.
- Transcriptions or AI-generated text will be accurate or complete.
- The Service will meet your specific requirements.

Voice-to-text transcription and AI post-processing are inherently imperfect. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying any output produced by the Service.

## 13. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HANDAPTIVE LLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.

OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

## 14. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Handaptive LLC and its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

## 15. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for violation of these Terms or for any other reason, with or without notice. You may stop using the Service and delete your account at any time. Upon termination, your right to use the cloud Service ceases, but your locally stored data remains on your device.

## 16. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date and may notify you through the application or by other means. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 17. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Utah.

## 18. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

## 19. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Handaptive LLC regarding the Service and supersede any prior agreements.
