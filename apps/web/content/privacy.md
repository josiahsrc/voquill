# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 20, 2025_

Voquill is a completely open source, privacy-first application. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to your data and privacy when you use our application.

## 1. Open Source & Local-First

Voquill is fully open source software that runs locally on your device. You have complete control over your data, and we do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal information.

## 2. Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal information.** Specifically:

- No account registration or personal details required
- No tracking, analytics, or telemetry
- No cookies or persistent identifiers
- No usage statistics or crash reports sent to us
- No email addresses, names, or contact information collected

## 3. Audio & Transcription Processing

### 3.1 Local Processing

All audio processing and transcription can be performed entirely on your local device. When running locally:

- Audio never leaves your device
- Transcriptions are processed and stored locally
- You have complete control over all data

### 3.2 Optional Groq API Usage

If you choose to use the Groq API for transcription:

- Audio data is sent to Groq's servers for processing
- This is entirely optional and under your control
- We do not receive, store, or have access to any data sent to Groq
- Groq's privacy practices are governed by their own privacy policy
- You can switch between local and API processing at any time

## 4. Data Storage

All data generated by Voquill (including recordings, transcriptions, and settings) is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to, cannot view, and do not store any of your data on remote servers.

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1 Groq API (Optional)

If you opt to use the Groq API, your audio data will be processed by Groq according to their privacy policy. We recommend reviewing [Groq's Privacy Policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy/) if you choose to use their service.

### 5.2 No Other Third Parties

We do not integrate with any other third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## 6. Your Control

Since Voquill runs entirely on your device:

- You have complete control over all data
- You can delete any data at any time through your device's file system
- You can audit the source code to verify our privacy claims
- You can run the application completely offline (when not using Groq API)

## 7. Open Source Transparency

Voquill's source code is publicly available and can be audited by anyone. This transparency ensures that our privacy claims can be independently verified.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any personal information, Voquill can be used by individuals of any age. Parents and guardians should supervise their children's use of any third-party services (such as the optional Groq API).

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Since we don't collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes.
